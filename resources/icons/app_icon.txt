Universal Hardware Debugger and Serial Monitor Icon

This file is a placeholder for the application icon.
In a production environment, this would be replaced with a proper icon file (PNG, ICO, or SVG).

The icon design would feature:
- Circuit board traces
- Microcontroller representation
- Serial data visualization
- Connection points
- Color scheme matching the application theme
